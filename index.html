            <h2>Introduction: Imagine an AI ü§ñ at a cocktail party üçª </h2>
            Imagine this: you're at a vibrant cocktail party üçπ, filled with the buzz of conversation and the clink of
            glasses üçª. You're
            a laid-back observer üëÄ, tucked comfortably in a corner. Yet, you can still easily figure out the social
            relations between
            different people, understand what's going on, and even provide social suggestions by reading people's
            verbal and
            non-verbal cues.

            <!-- Imagine this, put a human observer in a cocktail party.
                This observer can be very laid back, but can still easily figure out the social relation between
                different
                people, understand what's going on, and provide social suggestions by reading people's verbal and
                non-verbal cues.
                If a language model can achieve this goal <strong>consistently</strong>, then it possesses social
                abilities to certain extent. Wondering how these LLMs' are doing in understanding social situations?

            <br>
            If a large language model (LLM) could replicate this level of social aptitude, then we could say that it
            possesses
            certain social abilities. Curious how different LLMs perform when it comes to understanding and
            navigating social
            interactions? Check out these demos processed by AI models<sup>**</sup>!
            <!-- <p style="font-size:20px;font-family: Calibri,Candara,Segoe,Segoe UI,Optima,Arial,sans-serif;">
                There have been lots of discussions around LLM's capabilities to understand social situations on various
                tasks including theory
                of mind.
                But we still lack a <strong>holistic</strong> way to evaluate of LLM's differnt kinds social abilities
                <strong>continuously</strong>.
                Many previous studies focuses on assessing models' certain ability in one aspect (e.g.,Tomi for theory
                of mind, socialIQA for social commonsense) with a static test set using multiple choices or short
                free-form text in a dyadic setting.
                This could be prone to data contamination, ambuiguity in the questions and answers, and oversimplified
                social dynamics.

            (1) cover various aspects of social intelligence

            (3) involve complex group dynamics

            <h2>Results: GPT-4 tops the list, followed by Claude in many cases</h2>
            <p></p>
            We evaluated different models following <a href="https://github.com/tatsu-lab/alpaca_eval">AlpacaEval</a>
            with text-davinci-003 as reference,
            and performed an ablation study, where we removed non-verbal cues in the parenthesis (e.g., nervously
            sipping coffee, etc) from the context. Here are some interesting takeaways.<br><br>
            1. Among the two LLM-based evaluators, GPT-4 exhibits greater certainty and confidence in identifying the
            winning model, in comparison to Claude. <br><br>
            2. When the context has no non-verbal cues, and the interaction is either solely generated by
            GPT-4 or grounded on movies, Claude performs better than GPT-4 (agreed by both evaluators); while if the
            context contains non-verbal cues, GPT-4 is always better than Claude. One possible explanation is GPT-4
            is a multi-modal model, so as expected, it can better understand extra non-verbal information. Also note
            that
            when presented with non-verbal cues, the LLM-based evaluator perceives that the top-performing models have a
            more substantial advantage over less accomplished models. <br><br>
            3. One may be wondering that if the social interactions are generated by GPT-4, does that mean GPT-4 can
            already answer these questions? It seems that the source plays a smaller role compared to the type of
            questions.
            <br><br>
            4. It appears that LLM-based evaluators find it easier to determine the superior model in tasks unrelated
            to theory-of-mind, especially from samples generated from ToMi dataset. This may be due to the fact that
            even the LLM evaluator may struggle to discern the correct answer in theory-of-mind contexts. <br><br>
            5. Claude is good at giving social advice in many cases.

            <h2>Analysis</h2>
            <p>Our analysis of the results indicates that GPT-3 has significant potential for improving natural language
                processing tasks. However, there are still areas where further research is needed. For example, GPT-3
                has difficulty with understanding sarcasm and irony, which are important elements of human
                communication.</p>

        <section id="limitation">
            <h2>Limitations</h2>
            Our project, while exciting in many respects, does have certain limitations. First, the size of <span
                style="color: var(--koko-color)">Koko</span><span style="color: var(--mind-color)">Mind</span>
            is relatively
            small, which could limit the broad applicability and comprehensiveness of our conclusions. Secondly, all
            of the
            interactions in <span style="color: var(--koko-color)">Koko</span><span
                style="color: var(--mind-color)">Mind</span> are generated by GPT-4 and require human verification,
            which makes it hard to
            scale up the
            dataset. Besides, although
            <span style="color: var(--koko-color)">Koko</span><span style="color: var(--mind-color)">Mind</span>
            provides human-verfied answers in the dataset, we did not use these answers as a reference
            during evaluation, and as these answers are generated by GPT-4, they may be biased towards GPT-4 and
            future research can focus on how to evaluate models with human-verified machine-generated reference
            answers. Next, all the models we evaluated were versions prior to June 1, 2023. It is possible that
            newly released models may have better
            performance. Despite these limitations, we envision <span style="color: var(--koko-color)">Koko</span><span
                style="color: var(--mind-color)">Mind</span> as a springboard for future
            investigations
            related to social
            intellignece, multi-modal language models, etc.
